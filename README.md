The course cleanup tool is used to delete all courses in a category that have not been used. That is, it only has the Course announcements activity and no grade items.

I developed this plugin because we have to keep our courses for at least 5 years. However, I noticed that many courses that were created are empty. In order to keep the system clean, I wanted to delete these courses. However, there are too many to do manually. And so, this tool makes my life much easier.
